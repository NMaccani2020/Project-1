            <p id="cool" class=>Calvin and Hobbes is one of the most influential comic strips of all time. It was written by Bill Watterson, who ran the strip from November 18th, 1985 to December 31st, 1995. Even decades after a new strip was last printed in the newspaper, Calvin and Hobbes is still looked upon as one of the greatest comic strips ever written. Often said to be "the last great newspaper comic strip" Calvin and Hobbes follows the antics of Calvin, a hyperactive six year old boy who has a wild imagination, and Hobbes, a tiger that Calvin sees as a real tiger, but everyone else sees him as a stuffed tiger. Calvin and Hobbes do pretty much everything together. From getting revenge on their babysitter, to plotting water balloon attacks, going on adventures through their forest, the list goes on and on. Bill Watterson, author of the critically acclaimed comic strip, is well known for refusing to have his characters merchandised, as he believed it violated the value of the strip. He also felt it would "cheapen" his strip. To this day, no official Calvin and Hobbes merchandise has been released outside the book collections and two 18 month calenders. Bill Watterson even recieved offers from the likes of George Lucas, Disney, and even Steven Speilburg to potentially make an movie and/or TV show based off the strip, but Watterson rejected all of these.
